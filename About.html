               I  was born and raised in a family of three in  Nairobi Kenya.
               My family is a big part of who I am.I am always grateful for their love and support.<br>My friends, they describe me bigtime.I am always keen in choosing friends because I value friendship.<br>
               I am a jovial person and I came to discover I am a protagonist&#128515;my characters and values described with one word.<br>I practice gratitude everyday a way I get to appreciate everything that happens to me and around me.

               <h3 id="p2">Education</h3>
               <P >My education background is simple,started schooling in Ndurarua Primary School Nairobi 
                 <br>then later joined Kalukuni secondary School in Matuu Yatta for my secondary education.
                 <br>In 2016 after completing my secondary education,<br> I decided to take a short course in computer packages
                 <br>  in my area,that was like a norm after high school you either choose driving lessons or computer packages.
                 <br>I joined AkiraChix this year where I'm pursuing a course in computer programming and UI/UX design.&#128522;

               Generally, tech is magic I'm always fascinated on how lines of code can build amazing sites and softwares.<br>
               I love the way design and coding goes hand in hand and I always anticipate to be a great UI/UXdesigner and an amazing developer after the program.<br>
               I am also intersted in make up and photography and fun fact is, <br>they also go hand in hand too. &#128514;
               <br>
               The amazing thing is all my interests are kinda in pairs because,<br> 
               I also do bead work when I'm free and I'm also interested in knitting.&#128515;

          <p>In the story Born A Crime written by Trevor Noah, we learn about his stepfather Abel. Abel was a drunk, abusive, and insecure man. Despite everything Trevor’s mom still laid down and had another baby with him. They still survived all his hardships and trials. 
            From Trevor’s childhood onwards, when he and his mother bring their Volkswagen in for repairs, the auto mechanic Abel makes a way in their lives. In Eden park, Abel once beats up a  colored kid who is bullying Trevor and then threatens to kill the man’s father, which makes Trevor realize that Abel is genuinely dangerous.Abel being a man, being Patricia's husband .Abel couldn’t provide but wanted to control everything. Instead of talking out his problems he beat the mother of his son. it shows how a woman can be with a man and still be on her own, and it also shows that traditions can be changed or altered. 
            patriarchy is a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it. So basically when Abel was beating Patricia nothing could be done. The police ignored it  because back then a man could do whatever and it would be alright. It was okay for Abel to beat his family then drink, When the cops arrived he said nothing but oh-oh go in and have a conversation, this is not necessary. Patriarchy gave men leeway to do whatever.Patricia lived with a man,but still had to do everything on her own.  She paid her own bills, 
            took care of her own kids, and took care of herself. themselves. Patricia was the provider and the victim. She worked through the day then got her ass beat at night. Being with a man doesn’t mean anything, back then in South Africa men were held at such a high standard but Abel never met the requirements.

            Humor plays a central role in Noah’s approach to life and suffering. Although he scarcely discusses his comedy career in this memoir, his writing itself shows how humor can not only deflect and dull pain, but also and more crucially help people maintain a sense of realistic resilience in the face of obstacles,While he and his family clearly suffer, he by no means views his situation as tragic.<br>We start off in the episode in which his mother throws him out of a moving car.The memoir's first episode shows him, his mother, and his baby brother being endangered not by white men, but by Black men who belong to a different tribe.When they came to the next traffic his mother reached over,grabbed him and threw him out of the moving car. “And on and on and there we were,back at it arguing about God’s will.Finally I said,”Look,Mom .I know you love Jesus,but maybe next week you could ask him to meet us at our  house.Because this really wasn't a fun night.”They both started laughing together through their pain.This shows how Noah and his mother found humor in difficult situations.<br>”Thanks to my long walk to school,I was late single day.I’d have to stop off in the prefects office to write my name down for detention.I was the patron of detention.”Trevor was always late but he never saw that as a big deal.He was always on the list of the students who would go for detention and he found it as a joke,he would stand up before his name was called out like it was Oscars and he was Meryl Streep.<br>”You do not need to be accepted for everything you are just one part of yourself and willing to share.For me it was humor.I learned even though I didn't belong to one group I could be part of any group that was laughing.I’d drop in,pass out the snacks,tell a few jokes,I’d perform for them,catch a bit of their conversation,learn more about their group and then leave like I never overstayed my welcome.<br>In grade 8,Noah starts middle school in Sandringham a huge school that is racially and economically diverse.Noah has experienced intense poverty growing with his mother so fitting with the white kids was really big problem for him found a way to fit in though he did not have a specific group he was hanging out with.Neither was he popular nor an outcast ,he was everywhere with everybody and at the same time he was all by himself.As in many schools kids try to fit in to find as a sense of belonging,
             He didn't see it as a big deal,he was cool and comfortable with the whole situation.
